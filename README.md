# Complex-Dynamics-of-Magnetic-Billiards-in-a-2-Torus-CODE [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10030238.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10030238)

The code related files used for my MSc thesis titled *Complex Dynamics of Magnetic Billiards in a 2-Torus*. This repository contains:
- The Python package `magdynsys.py` I wrote to compute and visualize trajectories of a magnetic billiard in a 2-Torus,
- A Jupyter notebook `Stability analysis of periodic trajectories.ipynb` dedicated to stability analysis of certain periodic trajectories,
- A Jupyter notebook `Figures.ipynb` dedicated to creating all the figures in the thesis,
- PNG copies of all the figures in the thesis
- npy files of collected data needed to produce some of the figures. Provided for convenience, since it takes hours to collect.

To understand better what the code is doing and the purpose of the figures, it helps to read my thesis which will be available in the thesis repository of the University of Groningen via this [link](https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/view/degree_programme/mathematics/master/2023.html)
